# 🎮 Questify – Gamified Learning for Engineers

Questify is a **gamified engineering learning platform** that turns core computer science subjects into interactive quests.  
Students explore subject planets, complete quizzes, earn XP, unlock badges, and track progress through a game-style dashboard.

This project focuses on **modern frontend design, gamification principles, and clean UI architecture**.
